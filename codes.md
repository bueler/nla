# Matlab/Octave Codes

All the codes used for demonstrations in lecture, and in solutions to homework, will appear here.

See [this page](computing) and [this PDF](https://bueler.github.io/compareMOP.pdf) regarding tools for computing in this course.

## from lectures

  * [blockimage.m](assets/codes/F23/blockimage.m)  Show a real matrix as a grey-scale image.
  * [pie.mat](assets/codes/F23/pie.mat)  An image saved as a `.mat` Matlab data file.  Compare the [original image](assets/codes/F23/pie.png).
  * [piecompress.m](assets/codes/F23/piecompress.m)  Application of SVD.  Show low-rank, i.e. compressed, approximations of a matrix.

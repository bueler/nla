# Matlab/Octave Codes

All the codes used for demonstrations in lecture, and in solutions to homework, will appear here in due course.

  * [blockimage.m](assets/codes/F23/blockimage.m)  Show a real matrix as a grey-scale image.
  * [pie.mat](assets/codes/F23/pie.mat)  An image saved as a `.mat` Matlab data file.  Compare the [original image](assets/codes/F23/pie.png).
  * [piecompress.m](assets/codes/F23/piecompress.m)  Application of SVD.  Show low-rank, i.e. compressed, approximations of a matrix.

## from homework solutions

From Assignment #1:

  * [manipulations.m](assets/codes/F23/manipulations.m)
  * [matstats.m](assets/codes/F23/matstats.m)

From Assignment #2:

  * [matvec.m](assets/codes/F23/matvec.m)
  * [matmat.m](assets/codes/F23/matmat.m)
  * [fourballs.m](assets/codes/F23/fourballs.m)

## Homework Assignments

Each Homework Assignment has its own PDF.  The links below are in reverse chronological order.  The [Schedule](assets/general/F25/schedule.pdf) also shows the due dates.

Homework Assignments are **due at the start of class**.  Please turn in each Assignment electronically, as a single PDF.  (If you can only make a single document in another format, try that.)  Make sure it has your name on the upper-right corner of the first page.  Please clearly indicate the assignment number in the title, and clearly indicate the beginning of each exercise/problem.

Turn in the Assignment by file upload to the [Assignments tab on the Canvas course page](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/27130).

After each Assignment is due, complete solutions will be posted at the **Modules tab** of the [Canvas course page](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/27130).

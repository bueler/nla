## Homework Assignments

Each homework Assignment has its own PDF; the links are below.  Assignments are **due at the start of class**; see also the [Schedule](assets/general/F23/schedule.pdf) for due dates.  Please turn in each Assignment on paper, stapled in the upper-left corner, and with your name on the upper-right corner.  Also, please clearly indicate the assignment number in the title.

After each Assignment is due, complete solutions will be posted at the **Modules tab** of the [Canvas course page](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/15800).

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION!  MANY BROKEN LINKS!**

Welcome to the public homepage of **Math F614 Numerical Linear Algebra**, Fall 2023, in the [Dept. of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.uaf.edu/dms/) at the [University of Alaska Fairbanks](http://www.uaf.edu/).

If you plan to be present in Fairbanks during the semester, please sign up for the in-person "901" section (crn 75513), and plan to attend lecture in Chapman 107.  If you are genuinely remote, signing up for the web-based "701" section (crn 75512) is just fine!
